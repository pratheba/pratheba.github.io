I am a fifth year PhD student at University of Massachusetts, Amherst advised by Prof.Evangelos Kalogeraki. My interest are in 3D graphics and vision, generative modelling and geometry processing. I am also interested to explore multi modal domain applications and applications derived from cross domains.

Prior to joining PhD, I worked as a software engineer in Microsoft and couple of start-ups in silicon valley. I am originally from India, moved to US in 2011 to do my Masters in Computer science at Columbia University, Newyork. Outside of PhD work, I like to pain, do rock climbing, hiking and running with my 6year old Labrador, Happy.
