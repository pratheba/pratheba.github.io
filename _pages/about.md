I am a sixth year PhD student at University of Massachusetts, Amherst advised by Prof.Erik-Learned Miller and co-advised by Prof.Evangelos Kalogerakis. My interest are in 3D graphics and vision, generative modelling and geometry processing. I am interested in exploring problems where theory could be applied to practical 3D geometry and vision problems.

Prior to joining PhD, I worked as a software engineer in Microsoft and start-ups in silicon valley. I did my Masters in Computer science at Columbia University, Newyork. Outside of PhD work, I like to paint, rock climb, hike and run with my dog, Happy.
