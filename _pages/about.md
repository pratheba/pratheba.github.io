## **<center>ABOUT ME</center>**

I am a PhD candidate in [Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I am advised by [Prof.Erik-Learned Miller](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/index.html) and co-advised by [Prof.Evangelos Kalogerakis](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/).

My interest is in 3D Computer vision and graphics, especially in generative modelling, rendering and geometry processing. I am interested in exploring problems where theory could be applied to practical 3D geometry and vision problems.

Before starting PhD, I was a software engineer in Microsoft and start-ups in silicon valley. I did my Masters in Computer science at Columbia University, Newyork. Outside of PhD, I like to paint, rock climb, hike and run with my dog, Happy.
