<h3>Abstract</h3>
Reconstructing a 3D face from a single-view image presents challenges due to its ill-posed nature, which is further compounded when the image contains occlusions. The current state-of-the-art methods performs well in reconstructing a single head shape but face difficulties with occlusions unable to offer multiple hypotheses for obscured regions. Methods that attempt to address this issue often fail to capture all modes of expression and produces unrealistic facial reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a two layer approach to address these challenges. <i>First layer</i> uses 2-stage conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilitic Method (DDPM) which generates 3D faces (samples) given an image as condition. DDPM is designed to understand the underlying statistical properties of data (here faces) hence can generate realistic faces covering all modes of expression. <i>Second Layer</i> introduces a novel ranking mechanism to select the most optimal reconstructed face from the generated samples. Rather than solely focusing on improving the architectural aspects of the methods, we explore the concept of <b>"almost sure convergence"</b> ensuring that, with a sufficiently large number of samples, at least one will closely resemble the ground truth. Our approach shifts the problem statement of reconstruction towards selecting the best sample from any reasonable generative model by applying the ranking principles rooted in Information Retrieval.
